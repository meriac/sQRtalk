sQRtalk.com speaker management application


== Installation ==

Please find more information and installation guidelines
at http://www.openbeacon.org/SQRtalk

Please add CMS token BERLINSYMPOSIUM_API_TOKEN to www/config.php
and configure a database called 'sqrtalk' with r/w access rights.
The database is configured in www/config.php, too.

The default database layout can be found at helpers/default.sql in
SQL database dump format - you can use the mysql command line tool or
phpMyAdmin to create the database and run the SQL script.

Please run the 'precache.php' script in the directory 'helpers' to
fetch the whole user list from the content management system (CMS).
This script needs to be either run after every update or regularly in
a cron job.
